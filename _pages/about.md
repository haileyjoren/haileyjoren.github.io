I'm a fourth-year PhD student at UC San Diego, advised by [Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/). My research focuses on making generative models and ML systems more reliable, interpretable, and human-aligned. 

My work includes:
- **Augmented Generation Systems**: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for LLMs, structured inductive biases for diffusion models
- **Human-interactive Systems**: concept-bottleneck models (CBMs), privacy-preserving models for healthcare
- **Document Analysis and Security**: adversarial robustness, graph-neural networks for document manipulation detection

## Academic Service and Teaching
### Graduate Women in Computing (GradWIC) Mentorship Director
I ran the GradWIC mentorship program. With over 150 participants, I match incoming students from underrepresented backgrounds with experienced
graduate student mentors and supervise mentorship across all mentor pairings.

### Teaching

I volunteered as a **lecturer and teaching assistant** for [AddisCoder](https://www.addiscoder.com/), a summer program that teaches computer science to high school 
students in Ethiopia. 

I served as a **teaching assistant** for CSE258: Recommendation System and Web Mining, 
taught by [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).

During college, I served as a **Harvard Patel Fellow**, the recipient of a fellowship that allowed me 
to work with teaching staff to support students of diverse backgrounds and work individually with students in an
introductory computer science course.
