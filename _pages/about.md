I'm a third-year PhD student at UC San Diego advised by [Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/). I research how we can build and understand human-centered AI using tools like uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and generative modeling.

<!--- minimizing data collection: how can we design interpretable machine learning systems that minimize data collection and maximize fairness and predictive performance? (see [Participatory Personalization in Classification NeurIPS 2023 Spotlight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03874))
- building data-efficient systems: how can we use domain-specific data to build more efficient and less data-hungry diffusion models? (see [DYffusion: A Dynamics-informed Diffusion Model for Spatiotemporal Forecasting NeurIPS 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01984))
- uncertainty-aware interventions: how can we leverage uncertainty quantification in scaling interpretable models? (preprint coming soon!)
- training for task relevance: how can we bias generative and graph-based models to prioritize the features human reviewers think are most important? (see [Learning Document Graphs with Attention for Image Manipulation Detection ICPRAI 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09037-0_22))
- fairness in NLP: how can we use distribution information and probabilistic modeling to reduce bias in NLP tasks? (see [Probabilistic Bias Mitigation in Word Embeddings Neurips HCML Workshop 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14497))

I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Harvard. After graduation I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer, first at Lendbuzz, a startup dedicated to increasing access to financial services, and then at Twitter Cortex. Outside of research, you can find me training for my next triathlon, open-water swimming, or working in my garden.

## Service and Teaching
### Graduate Women in Computing (GradWIC) Mentorship Director
I run the GradWIC a mentorship program. With over 150 participants, I match incoming students from underrepresented backgrounds with experienced
graduate student mentors and supervise mentorship across all mentor pairings. 
<!---As a member of the GradWIC board, I support the organization of events and workshops for
the UCSD computing community, with a focus on supporting women and underrepresented groups.--->


### Teaching

I volunteered as a **lecturer and teaching assistant** for [AddisCoder](https://www.addiscoder.com/), a summer program that teaches computer science to high school 
students in Ethiopia. 

I am currently a **teaching assistant** for CSE258: Recommendation System and Web Mining, 
taught by [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).

During college, I served as a **Harvard Patel Fellow**, the recipient of a fellowship that allowed me 
to work with teaching staff to support students of diverse backgronds and work individually with students in an
introductory computer science course.
