I'm a PhD student at UC San Diego advised by [Berk Ustun](https://www.berkustun.com/). I'm broadly interested in questions related to human-centered AI, explainability, and human-AI collaboration. Topics I've been investigating lately include:

- participatory systems: how can we design interpretable machine learning systems that minimize data collection and maximize fairness and predictive performance? (e.g., in healthcare [James et al 2022 NeurIPS TSRML Workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03874))
- uncertainty-aware interventions: how can we leverage uncertainty quantification in scaling interpretable models? 
- training for task relevance: how can we bias generative and graph-based models to prioritize the features human reviewers think are most important? (e.g., in forgery detection [James et al ICPRAI 2022](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09037-0_22) and [climate forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01984))
- fairness in NLP: how can we use distribution information and probabilistic modeling to reduce bias in NLP tasks? ([e.g., James et al Neurips HCML Workshop 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14497))

I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Harvard. After graduation I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer, first at Lendbuzz, a startup dedicated to increasing access to financial services, and then at Twitter Cortex. Outside of research, you can find me training for my next triathlon, swimming at La Jolla Shores, and in the kitchen trying out new vegan recipes.
