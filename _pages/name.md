**Who is Hailey James?**
James is my given name, Joren is my married name. I recently changed my name, so most of my publications are still listed under Hailey James.

**Why Joren?**
Joren is a combination of mine and my spouse’s names. We chose it because it is a Scandinavian name, which reflects our family heritage, and because it means “carer of the earth,” which reflects our family values. We didn’t want to choose between our names, since choosing one meant leaving behind the other. Instead, we chose to follow our family tradition of “generational naming”, in which a new generation receives or chooses for themselves a new family name that reflects their history and values.

**Why change your name now?**
We “put off” the decision of our names by hyphenating our names socially and keeping our given names professionally, but knew we would eventually like to combine our names for a single family name. The right timing ended up being when my spouse started a new job and when I started to publish more in my PhD.

**Is it hard to change your name? Do you have any advice?**
Choosing a name for marriage is a difficult decision with no single right answer, so I would recommend keeping your given name until you feel fully satisfied with your decision. That said, knowing what we know now, we would change our names when we got married. If we had done so, we could have simply written our new name on our marriage certificate (at least in California) and used the marriage certificate to change all other legal documents. Instead we are required to go through a more involved and expensive legal process. From a professional perspective, women and transgender scientists have fortunately paved the way to make changing one’s name as a researcher much easier than it used to be.
