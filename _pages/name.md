**Who is Hailey James?**
James is my given name and Joren is my married name. I recently changed my name, so most of my publications are still listed under Hailey James.

**Why Joren?**
Joren is a blend of my name and my spouse's name. It is also Scandinavian name that reflects our family heritage and means "carer of the earth." We didn't want to choose between our names, since choosing one meant leaving behind the other. Instead, we decided to follow our family tradition of "generational naming," in which a new generation receives or chooses for themselves a new family name that reflects their history and values. Both of our great-great-grandfathers followed this tradition and it is one we're excited to revive.

**Why change your name now?**
We put off the decision of our names by hyphenating our names socially and keeping our given names professionally, but we knew we would eventually like to combine our names for a single family name. The right timing ended up being now that I'm publishing more in my PhD and gaining more visibility.

**Is it hard to change your name? Do you have any advice?**
Choosing a name for marriage is a difficult decision with no single right answer, so I would recommend keeping your given name until you feel fully satisfied with your decision. That said, knowing what we know now, we would change our names when we got married. If we had done so, we could have simply written our new name on our marriage certificate (at least in California) and used the marriage certificate to change all other legal documents. Instead, we are required to go through a more involved and expensive legal process. From a professional perspective, women and transgender scientists have fortunately paved the way to make changing one's name as a researcher much easier than it used to be.
