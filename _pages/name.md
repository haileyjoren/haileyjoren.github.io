**Who is Hailey James?**
James is my given name and Joren is my married name. I recently changed my name, so many of my publications are still 
listed under Hailey James.

**Why Joren?**
Joren is a blend of my name and my spouse's name. It is also Scandinavian name that reflects our family heritage and 
means "carer of the earth." Rather than choosing between our names or hyphenating (both valid options!), we decided to 
follow our family tradition of "generational naming," in which a new generation receives or chooses for themselves a new
family name that reflects their history and values. Both of our great-great-grandfathers followed this tradition and it 
is one we're excited to revive.

**Why change your name now?**
We put off the decision of our names by hyphenating our names socially and keeping our given names professionally, but 
we knew we would eventually like to combine our names for a single family name. The right timing ended up being now that
I'm publishing more in my PhD and gaining more visibility.

**Is it hard to change your name? Do you have any advice?**
Choosing a name for marriage is a difficult decision with no single right answer. Blending our names was the right
decision for my spouse and me, but in my opinion, there's no perfect or obvious choice. We didn't mind 
having conversations with curious familly and friends, and resigned ourselves to a more involved and expensive legal 
process. Our priorities included having a single name for our family and children while still 
honoring each of our families and our own identities.
From a professional perspective, women and transgender scientists have fortunately paved the way to make changing one's 
name as a researcher much easier than it used to be.
